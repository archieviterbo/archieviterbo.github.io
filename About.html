          <h3> I have two career goals if ever i graduate</h3><br>
          
          <p>During my senior high school years, my passion for gaming became the catalyst for a dream 
             to become a Game Developer. Whether immersed in the world of online games or enjoying the 
             complexity of PC and mobile games, my fascination with the gaming realm fueled my desire to 
             explore the mysteries behind their creation. It's not just about playing; it's about understanding 
             the intricate process of development. Opting for a career in Game Development is not only an indulgence 
             in my love for games but also a commitment to unravel the secrets that make them captivating. Learning the 
             language of Game Development serves as a tool 
            to hone my skills, allowing me to contribute to the creation and enhancement of gaming experiences
             while delving deeper into its principles.
             <br> <br>

            While my primary passion lies in game development, I also recognize the immense potential in 
            the field of cybersecurity. Encouraged by the advice of my professors and the promising prospects 
            it offers, I am drawn to the cybersecurity domain. Beyond the allure of safeguarding digital landscapes,
             the substantial salary opportunities associated with this field contribute to my interest. Hence, cybersecurity
              stands as my second choice, not only for its financial appeal but also for the challenging and dynamic nature
               of the work. The combination of my love for gaming and the potential in the cybersecurity field propels me toward 
               a future where I can navigate both worlds with enthusiasm and expertise.
